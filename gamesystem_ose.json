Should this location already be occupied by solid matter, the subject is instantly killed. Otherwise, the subject falls from a height.\nToo low: The subject appears in the ground and is killed instantly.\nKnowledge of destination: The caster‚Äôs knowledge of the destination is rated as follows:\n‚ñ∂ Scant: A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions.\n‚ñ∂ Moderate: A location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying for several weeks.\n‚ñ∂ Exact: A location that the caster has made a detailed study of, in person."
